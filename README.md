## 📚 Currently Learning

I'm actively deepening my understanding of core computer science concepts and refining my ability to communicate technical solutions clearly — both in writing and in spoken interviews. This includes:
- JavaScript fundamentals and internals (execution model, closures, memory, async behavior)
- Data structures & algorithms, with a focus on real interview patterns
- Technical communication and system design principles
- Golang, exploring backend performance and concurrency models

I believe strong foundations are key to long-term success as a software engineer, and I'm committed to mastering both the theory and practice behind the tools I use daily.
